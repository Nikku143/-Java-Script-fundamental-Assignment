List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

ans:-



1:--Number
Number data type in javascript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.

ex:-

let x = 250;
let y = 40.5;
console.log("Value of x=" + x);
console.log("Value of y=" + y);

Output
Value of x=250
Value of y=40.5

2:-String
The string data type in JavaScript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by single or double quotes.

ex:-
let str = 'Hello All';
let str1 = "Welcome to my new house";
console.log("Value of str=" + str);
console.log("Value of str1=" + str1);

Output
Value of str=Hello All
Value of str1=Welcome to my new house

3:-Undefined
The meaning of undefined is ‘value is not assigned’.

ex:-
console.log("Value of x=" + x);


4:-Boolean
The boolean data type can accept only two values i.e. true and false.


ex:-

console.log("value of bool=" + bool);

output:
true

4:-Null
This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.

ex:
let x = null;
	console.log("Value of x=" + x);



Output
Value of x=null

5:-BigInt
This data type can represent numbers greater than 253-1 which helps to perform operations on large numbers. The number is specified by writing ‘n’ at the end of the value

ex:

let bigNum = 123422222222222222222222222222222222222n
console.log(bigNum)

Output
123422222222222222222222222222222222222n
