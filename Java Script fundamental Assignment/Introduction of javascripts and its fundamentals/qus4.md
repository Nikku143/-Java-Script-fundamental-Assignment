What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

ans:-
Just like var in Javascript, let keyword is also used for variable declaration. But the only difference is the variable declared with the “let” keyword is block-scoped and local variable. A variable declared with let will be out of scope outside the block within which it has been declared.
