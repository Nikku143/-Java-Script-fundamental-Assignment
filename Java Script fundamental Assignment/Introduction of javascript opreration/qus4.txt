Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?


ans:--

Operator precedence and associativity are essential concepts that help us understand
 how to evaluate expressions containing multiple operations. JavaScript defines certain rules
  and assigns priorities to all the operators in order to determine
 the sequence of executing these operations in an expression.
